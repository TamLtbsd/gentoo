	Aeolus is a synthesised (i.e. not sampled) pipe organ emulator that should
	be good enough to make an organist enjoy playing it. It is a software
	synthesiser optimised for this job, with possibly hundreds of controls for
	each stop, that enable the user to "voice" his instrument.

	Main features of the default instrument: three manuals and one pedal, five
	different temperaments, variable tuning, MIDI control of course, stereo,
	surround or Ambisonics output, flexible audio controls including a large
	church reverb.
